    <h1>Bonfire</h1>
    
    <p>You're a Rubyist. You want to write a book. You want to write an <em>ebook</em>. You might have Apple Pages. Adobe
    InDesign? Unlikely. Microsoft Word? Not on your life.</p>
    
    <p>When it comes to text, you think in Markdown and HTML. You're not afraid of the command line and editing a little
    CSS. But you need tools in order to publish a book. What do you do?</p>
    
    <p>You light a Bonfire.</p>
    
    <h2>Write in Markdown</h2>
    
    <p>With Bonfire your book's sections are Markdown files. You can name these files however you like and reorder them at
    will in <code>bonfire.yml</code>.</p>
    
    <p>At any time you can make a single-file draft html version of your book for offline editing, sharing with others,
    and even marking up with a red pen (just like your High School English teacher).</p>
    
    <p>Writing is the hard part.</p>
    
    <h2>Publish to a Directory</h2>
    
    <p>Publishing, which means putting all the data together in a directory of ebook-happy HTML and XML files, is the annoying part. Bonfire takes your Markdown and builds a set of HTML, CSS, image, and XML files that work as input to ebook "compilers".</p>
    
    <p>This project assumes you're going to publish to <a href="http://kdp.amazon.com">Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing platform</a>. We'll add ePub in a future release.</p>

    <h2>Contributor's Guide</h2>
    
    <p>All pull requests will be considered. But like all projects, we're opinionated. We welcome your contributions
    that are thoughtful and include specs. Pull requests without specs will be glossed over as they are clearly not
    thoughtful enough.</p>
    
    <p>If there's interest, we'll make an email list. In the meantime, Github Issues and direct emails are fine.</p>
