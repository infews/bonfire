    <h1>Bonfire</h1>
    
    <p>You're a Rubyist. You want to write a book. You want to write an <em>ebook</em>. You might have Apple Pages. Adobe
    InDesign? Unlikely. Microsoft Word? Not on your life.</p>
    
    <p>When it comes to text, you think in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, CSS and HTML. You're not afraid of the command line. But you need tools in order to publish a book. What do you do?</p>
    
    <p>You light a Bonfire.</p>
    
    <h2>Write in Markdown</h2>
    
    <p>With Bonfire your book's sections are Markdown files. You can name these files however you like and reorder them atwill in <code>bonfire.yml</code>.</p>
    
    <p>At any time you can make a single-file draft html version of your book for offline editing, sharing with others, and even marking up with a red pen (just like your High School English teacher).</p>
    
    <p>Writing is the hard part.</p>
    
    <h2>Publish to a Directory</h2>
    
    <p>Publishing, which means putting all the data together in a directory of ebook-happy HTML and XML files, is the annoying part. Bonfire takes your Markdown and builds a set of HTML, CSS, image, and XML files that work as input to ebook "compilers".</p>
    
    <p>Once we have this directory - which looks a whole lot like a website - we can make an ebook. This same set of files should publishable to <a href="http://kdp.amazon.com">Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing platform</a> or to any of the ePub systems (iBooks, B&amp;N Nook)</p>
    
    <h2>Using Bonfire</h2>

    $ mate . # or pick another editor
    </code></pre>
    
    
    <p>Now get writing. Did we mention that's the hard part?</p>
