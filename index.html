    <h1>Bonfire</h1>
    
    <p>You're a Rubyist. You want to write a book. You want to write an <em>ebook</em>. You might have Apple Pages. Adobe
    InDesign? Unlikely. Microsoft Word? Not on your life.</p>
    
    <p>When it comes to text, you think in Markdown and HTML. You're not afraid of the command line and editing a little
    CSS. But you need tools in order to publish a book. What do you do?</p>
    
    <p>You light a Bonfire.</p>
    
    <h2>Write in Markdown</h2>
    
    <p>With Bonfire your book's sections are Markdown files. You can name these files however you like and reorder them at
    will in <code>bonfire.yml</code>.</p>
    
    <p>At any time you can make a single-file draft html version of your book for offline editing, sharing with others,
    and even marking up with a red pen (just like your High School English teacher).</p>
    
    <p>Writing is the hard part. Publishing, which means putting all the data together in a set of ebook-happy HTML and XML
    files, is the annoying part. Which is why we have Ruby and it's amazing tools for manipulating your masterwork and
    compiling it into a format that works with the various ebook tools.</p>
    
    <h2>Publishing</h2>
    
    <p>This project assumes you're going to publish to <a href="http://kdp.amazon.com">Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing platform</a>.
    KDP expects your book to be a directory of HTML files, some minimal CSS, a few images, and a couple of ebook XML files.
    Bonfire helps you with all of these.</p>
    
    <p>We'll add ePub in a future release.</p>

    <h2>Contributor's Guide</h2>
    
    <p>All pull requests will be considered. But like all projects, we're opinionated. We welcome your contributions
    that are thoughtful and include specs. Pull requests without specs will be glossed over as they are clearly not
    thoughtful enough.</p>
    
    <p>If there's interest, we'll make an email list. In the meantime, Github Issues and direct emails are fine.</p>
