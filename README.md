## Contributor's Guide

All pull requests will be considered. But like all projects, we're opinionated. We welcome your contributions
that are thoughtful and include specs. Pull requests without specs will be glossed over as they are clearly not
thoughtful enough.

If there's interest, we'll make an email list. In the meantime, Github Issues and direct emails are fine.
